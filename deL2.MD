#### 1. What is SQL and its significance in database management?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to query, insert, update, and delete data. SQL is significant in database management because it provides a consistent and efficient way to interact with the database, ensuring data integrity and efficient data handling.

#### 2. Explain the difference between SQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.
- **SQL**: The language used for querying and managing relational databases.
- **MySQL**: An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL.
- **SQL Server**: A relational database management system developed by Microsoft that also uses SQL.

#### 3. What are the different types of SQL commands?
SQL commands are classified into:
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: GRANT, REVOKE.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT.

#### 4. What is a database schema?
A database schema defines the structure of the database, including tables, views, indexes, relationships, and other elements. It is a blueprint that outlines how data is organized and how relationships between data are managed.

#### 5. Explain the difference between a primary key and a foreign key.
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot be NULL.
- **Foreign Key**: A field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It creates a relationship between the two tables.

#### 6. What is a NULL value in SQL?
A NULL value represents missing or unknown data in a column. It is different from zero or an empty string and means that no value has been assigned to that field.

#### 7. What are the various data types supported in SQL?
Common data types in SQL include:
- **Numeric**: INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL.
- **Character**: CHAR, VARCHAR.
- **Date and Time**: DATE, TIME, DATETIME.
- **Binary**: BLOB.
- **Boolean**: BOOLEAN (some databases support this).

#### 8. Explain the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types.
- **CHAR**: Fixed-length character data type. It pads extra spaces to fill the specified length.
- **VARCHAR**: Variable-length character data type. It stores only the actual number of characters, plus one byte for the length.

#### 9. What is a constraint in SQL? Provide examples of different types of constraints.
A constraint is a rule enforced on data columns in a table to ensure data integrity. Examples include:
- **Primary Key**: Ensures unique identification of each row.
- **Foreign Key**: Maintains referential integrity between tables.
- **Unique**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
- **Not Null**: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
- **Check**: Ensures all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.

- **Multi-line comment**: `/* This is a multi-line comment */`

### Intermediate SQL Interview Questions

#### 11. What is a SQL query?
A SQL query is a statement used to perform a specific task, such as retrieving data from a database, updating records, or deleting data. For example: `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';`

#### 12. Explain the difference between DDL, DML, and DCL commands in SQL.
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Defines and modifies database structures. Commands include CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Manipulates data within existing structures. Commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Controls access to the data. Commands include GRANT, REVOKE.

#### 13. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses in SQL?
- **WHERE**: Filters rows before grouping them. Used with SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statements.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;
  ```
- **HAVING**: Filters groups after the aggregation is performed. Used with GROUP BY clause.
  ```sql
  SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
  ```

#### 14. Explain the concept of JOIN in SQL with examples.
JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column:
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records with matching values in both tables.
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.department
  FROM employees
  INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
  ```
- **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.department
  FROM employees
  LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
  ```
- **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.department
  FROM employees
  RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
  ```
- **FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)**: Returns records when there is a match in one of the tables. If no match, NULLs are returned.
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.department
  FROM employees
  FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
  ```

#### 15. What is a subquery in SQL?
A subquery is a query nested within another SQL query. It can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements to provide results to the main query.
Example:
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE department = 'Sales');
```

#### 16. How do you perform sorting in SQL?
Sorting is performed using the `ORDER BY` clause. You can sort results in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.
Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY name ASC;
```

#### 17. What is a stored procedure? How do you create and execute a stored procedure in SQL?
A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be saved and reused. It can accept parameters and perform complex operations.
- **Create**:
  ```sql
  CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCount
  AS
  BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
  END;
  ```
- **Execute**:
  ```sql
  EXEC GetEmployeeCount;
  ```

#### 18. Explain the concept of transaction management in SQL.
Transaction management ensures that a series of SQL operations are executed as a single unit, maintaining data integrity. It uses commands like:
- **BEGIN TRANSACTION**: Starts a transaction.
- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made during the transaction.
- **ROLLBACK**: Reverts changes made during the transaction if an error occurs.
Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO accounts (account_number, balance) VALUES (12345, 1000);
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_number = 12345;
COMMIT;
```

#### 19. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL?
- **UNION**: Combines results of two or more SELECT statements and removes duplicates.
- **UNION ALL**: Combines results of two or more SELECT statements and includes duplicates.
Example:
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales'
UNION
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Marketing';
```

#### 20. How do you handle duplicate records in a SQL query?
To handle duplicates, you can use the `DISTINCT` keyword to select only unique records.
Example:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM employees;
```

### Advanced SQL Interview Questions

#### 21. Explain the concept of indexing in SQL. How does indexing improve query performance?
Indexing is a way to optimize database performance by creating a data structure (index) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations. Indexes allow the database to find data quickly without scanning the entire table.
Example:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees(name);
```

#### 22. What are the different types of indexes in SQL?
- **Clustered Index**: Determines the physical order of data in a table. Only one per table.
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Does not alter the physical order of data. Multiple non-clustered indexes per table.

#### 23. What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes?
- **Clustered Index**: Sorts and stores the data rows of the table or view in order based on the index key. One per table.
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Contains a separate structure from the data rows. Pointers to the data rows are sorted based on the index key. Multiple per table.

#### 24. Explain the concept of normalization and denormalization in SQL.
- **Normalization**: Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables.
- **Denormalization**: Process ofcombining tables to reduce the number of joins and improve query performance. Denormalization can involve adding redundant data to tables to simplify queries.

#### 25. What are SQL injection attacks, and how can they be prevented?
SQL injection is a type of cyberattack where malicious SQL code is inserted into input fields to manipulate databases. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or data loss. Prevention methods include:
- Using parameterized queries or prepared statements.
- Validating and sanitizing input data.
- Implementing proper authentication and access controls.

#### 26. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands in SQL?
- **DELETE**: Removes rows from a table based on a condition. It generates an entry in the transaction log for each deleted row.
- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows from a table. It is faster than DELETE because it does not generate individual transaction log entries.

#### 27. Explain the concept of triggers in SQL. When and why do we use triggers?
Triggers are special stored procedures that automatically execute in response to events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table. Triggers are used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, and automate tasks.

#### 28. What is the difference between an inner join and an outer join in SQL?
- **Inner Join**: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined.
- **Outer Join**: Returns all rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table. There are three types of outer joins: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.

#### 29. Explain the concept of recursive queries in SQL. Provide an example.
Recursive queries are SQL queries that reference a table multiple times in the FROM clause. They are used to perform hierarchical or tree-structured queries.
Example:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
  SELECT id, name, manager_id
  FROM employees
  WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id
  FROM employees e
  JOIN cte ON e.manager_id = cte.id
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

#### 30. How do you handle NULL values in SQL?
You can handle NULL values in SQL using functions like COALESCE or IS NULL.
- **COALESCE**: Returns the first non-NULL value in a list of expressions.
  ```sql
  SELECT COALESCE(column_name, 'N/A') FROM table_name;
  ```
- **IS NULL**: Checks if a value is NULL.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
  ```

### Additional Topics Possibly Asked in TCS Prime Interview:

Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. Examples include ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and LEAD().
Example:
```sql
SELECT name, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```

#### 33. What are the different types of SQL constraints, and how do you enforce them?
SQL constraints include NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, and DEFAULT. They are enforced using the ALTER TABLE or CREATE TABLE statements.

#### 34. Explain the concept of data integrity in SQL. How do you ensure data integrity in a database?
Data integrity ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data stored in a database. It is maintained through constraints, referential integrity, and transaction management.

#### 35. Discuss the differences between SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL in terms of features and capabilities.
SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL are all popular relational database management systems (RDBMS) with different features, licensing models, and performance characteristics. Comparing them involves examining factors such as scalability, availability, security, and cost.

### Basic OS Interview Questions

#### 1. Why is the operating system important?
The operating system (OS) is crucial because it acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources, provides a user interface, and enables the execution of applications. Without an OS, users would have to write complex code to perform even basic tasks, and resource management would be inefficient.

#### 2. What's the main purpose of an OS? What are the different types of OS?
The main purposes of an OS are to manage hardware resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices), provide a user interface, and facilitate the execution of applications. The different types of OS include:
- **Batch Operating Systems**: Process jobs in batches without user interaction.
- **Time-Sharing Operating Systems**: Allow multiple users to use the system simultaneously by rapidly switching between them.
- **Distributed Operating Systems**: Manage a group of independent computers and make them appear as a single computer.
- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**: Provide immediate processing for real-time applications.
- **Network Operating Systems**: Manage network resources and allow communication between computers.
- **Mobile Operating Systems**: Designed for mobile devices, managing hardware and providing a platform for applications (e.g., Android, iOS).

#### 3. What are the benefits of a multiprocessor system?
Multiprocessor systems, which use two or more CPUs within a single computer system, offer several benefits:
- **Increased Throughput**: More processors can handle more tasks simultaneously.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If one processor fails, others can continue to work, enhancing system reliability.
- **Scalability**: Systems can be easily expanded by adding more processors.
- **Resource Sharing**: Multiple processors can share system resources like memory and I/O devices.

#### 4. What is RAID structure in OS? What are the different levels of RAID configuration?
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a technology that combines multiple disk drives into a single unit to improve performance and/or provide data redundancy. Different RAID levels include:
- **RAID 0**: Striped disks (no redundancy); improves performance.
- **RAID 1**: Mirrored disks; provides redundancy by duplicating data.
- **RAID 5**: Block-level striping with distributed parity; offers a good balance of performance and redundancy.
- **RAID 6**: Similar to RAID 5 but with double distributed parity; allows for two disk failures.
- **RAID 10**: Combines RAID 1 and RAID 0; offers both striping and mirroring.

#### 5. What is GUI?
GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators, rather than text-based commands. Examples include Windows, macOS, and GNOME on Linux.

#### 6. What is a Pipe and when it is used?
A pipe is a method used in OS for inter-process communication. It allows data to be passed from one process to another in a unidirectional flow. Pipes are commonly used in command-line interfaces to pass the output of one command as input to another.

#### 7. What are the different kinds of operations that are possible on semaphore?
Semaphores are synchronization tools used to control access to shared resources. The main operations on semaphores are:
- **wait (P)**: Decreases the semaphore value and may block the process if the semaphore value is zero.
- **signal (V)**: Increases the semaphore value and may unblock a waiting process.

#### 8. What is a bootstrap program in OS?
A bootstrap program, or bootloader, is the initial code that runs when a computer is powered on. It is responsible for initializing the hardware and loading the operating system into memory to start execution.

#### 9. Explain demand paging?
Demand paging is a memory management scheme where pages of a process are loaded into memory only when they are needed, rather than loading the entire process into memory at the start. This reduces memory usage and allows more processes to run simultaneously.

#### 10. What do you mean by RTOS?
RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) is an OS designed to process data as it comes in, typically within a guaranteed time frame. It is used in applications where timely processing is critical, such as embedded systems, medical devices, and industrial control systems.

#### 11. What do you mean by process synchronization?
Process synchronization refers to the coordination of processes to ensure that they execute in a specific order when accessing shared resources, to avoid conflicts and ensure data consistency. Mechanisms like semaphores, mutexes, and monitors are used for synchronization.

#### 12. What is IPC? What are the different IPC mechanisms?
IPC (Inter-Process Communication) refers to methods used by processes to communicate and synchronize with each other. Common IPC mechanisms include:
- **Pipes**: Unidirectional communication channels.
- **Message Queues**: Allow processes to send and receive messages.
- **Shared Memory**: Multiple processes can access the same memory space.
- **Sockets**: Used for communication over a network.
- **Semaphores**: Used for signaling and resource access control.

#### 13. What is different between main memory and secondary memory?
- **Main Memory**: Also known as RAM (Random Access Memory), it is fast, volatile, and directly accessible by the CPU. It is used to store data and programs that are currently in use.
- **Secondary Memory**: Non-volatile storage such as hard drives, SSDs, and optical disks. It is slower than main memory and used for long-term storage of data and programs.

#### 14. What do you mean by overlays in OS?
Overlays are a memory management technique used to overcome the limitations of a small main memory. A program is divided into sections, and only the necessary sections are loaded into memory at any time. This allows larger programs to run on systems with limited memory.

#### 15. Write top 10 examples of OS?
1. Microsoft Windows
2. macOS
3. Linux (various distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian)
4. Android
5. iOS
6. Unix
7. Chrome OS
8. FreeBSD
9. Solaris
10. BlackBerry OS

### Intermediate OS Interview Questions

#### 16. What is virtual memory?
Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources" that are actually available on a given machine. It creates an illusion for users of a very large main memory by using a portion of the secondary storage (such as a hard disk) to extend physical memory.

#### 17. What is thread in OS?
A thread is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS. It is a part of a process and shares resources like memory and file handles with other threads of the same process, but it has its own execution path and stack.

#### 18. What is a process? What are the different states of a process?
A process is an instance of a program in execution. It contains the program code and its current activity. The different states of a process are:
- **New**: The process is being created.
- **Running**: Instructions are being executed.
- **Waiting**: The process is waiting for some event to occur.
- **Ready**: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
- **Terminated**: The process has finished execution.

#### 19. What do you mean by FCFS?
FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) is a simple scheduling algorithm where the process that arrives first is executed first. It is non-preemptive, meaning that once a process starts executing, it runs to completion before the next process starts.

#### 20. What is Reentrancy?
Reentrancy is a property of a function or routine that allows it to be interrupted in the middle of its execution and safely called again ("re-entered") before the previous executions are complete. Reentrant code does not modify itself or rely on static or global data.

#### 21. What is a Scheduling Algorithm? Name different types of scheduling algorithms.
A scheduling algorithm determines the order in which processes are executed by the CPU. Different types of scheduling algorithms include:
- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
- **Round Robin**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
- **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**

#### 22. What is the difference between paging and segmentation?
- **Paging**: Divides the process's memory into fixed-size blocks called pages, which are mapped onto physical memory frames.
- **Segmentation**: Divides the process's memory into variable-sized segments based on logical divisions such as functions or data structures.

#### 23. What is thrashing in OS?
Thrashing occurs when a system spends more time swapping pages in and out of memory than executing actual processes. This happens when there is insufficient memory and too many processes are competing for resources, leading to constant paging activity.

#### 24. What is the main objective of multiprogramming?
The main objective of multiprogramming is to maximize CPU utilization by ensuring that the CPU always has a process to execute. It allows multiple processes to reside in memory simultaneously, so the CPU can switch to another process if the current process is waiting for I/O.

#### 25. What do you mean by asymmetric clustering?
Asymmetric clustering is a configuration where one or more nodes in the cluster are in standby mode while one node is active and handles all the workload. The standby nodes take over in case of a failure in the active node.

#### 26. What is the difference between multitasking and multiprocessing OS?
- **Multitasking OS**: Allows multiple tasks or processes to share a single CPU

, with the OS switching between them to give the illusion of concurrent execution.
- **Multiprocessing OS**: Uses multiple CPUs to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously, providing true parallelism.

#### 27. What do you mean by Sockets in OS?
Sockets are endpoints for communication between two machines. They enable inter-process communication (IPC) over a network by providing a communication channel between processes running on different machines or the same machine.

#### 28. Explain zombie process?
A zombie process is a process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table. This happens because the parent process has not yet read its exit status. The process is essentially dead but waiting for the parent to collect its termination status.

#### 29. What do you mean by cascading termination?
Cascading termination occurs when a parent process is terminated, and the OS automatically terminates all of its child processes. This ensures that no orphaned processes are left running.

#### 30. What is starvation and aging in OS?
- **Starvation**: A condition where a process is perpetually denied necessary resources due to the preference given to other processes.
- **Aging**: A technique used to prevent starvation by gradually increasing the priority of waiting processes, ensuring that they eventually get the necessary resources.

### Advanced OS Interview Questions

#### 31. What do you mean by Semaphore in OS? Why is it used?
A semaphore is a synchronization tool used to control access to shared resources by multiple processes. It uses two atomic operations, wait (P) and signal (V), to manage resource availability and prevent race conditions.

#### 32. What is Kernel and write its main functions?
The kernel is the core component of an OS, responsible for managing system resources and communication between hardware and software. Its main functions include:
- **Process Management**: Scheduling and managing processes.
- **Memory Management**: Allocating and managing memory.
- **Device Management**: Handling I/O devices and drivers.
- **File System Management**: Managing files and directories.
- **System Calls Handling**: Providing an interface for user programs to request services.

#### 33. What are different types of Kernel?
- **Monolithic Kernel**: All OS services run in kernel space, providing high performance but less modularity.
- **Microkernel**: Minimalist approach with only essential services in the kernel, enhancing modularity and security but potentially reducing performance.
- **Hybrid Kernel**: Combines aspects of monolithic and microkernels to balance performance and modularity.
- **Exokernel**: Provides minimal abstractions and leaves most services to user-space libraries.

#### 34. Write difference between micro kernel and monolithic kernel?
- **Microkernel**: Only essential services (e.g., IPC, basic scheduling) run in kernel space, while other services run in user space. It offers modularity and security but may have performance overhead due to frequent user-kernel transitions.
- **Monolithic Kernel**: All OS services run in kernel space, leading to high performance and efficient communication but less modularity and potential stability issues if one service fails.

#### 35. What is SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing)?
SMP is a multiprocessing architecture where two or more identical processors share a single memory and I/O bus. Each processor runs an instance of the OS, and they can execute processes concurrently, improving system performance and fault tolerance.

#### 36. What is a time-sharing system?
A time-sharing system allows multiple users to interact with a computer simultaneously by rapidly switching the CPU among them. Each user gets a small time slice, creating the illusion of concurrent execution and efficient resource utilization.

#### 37. What is Context Switching?
Context switching is the process of saving the state of a currently running process and restoring the state of the next process to be executed by the CPU. It involves switching the CPU's register set, program counter, and memory mappings, enabling multitasking.

#### 38. What is difference between Kernel and OS?
- **Kernel**: The core part of the OS that manages system resources and low-level hardware interactions.
- **OS (Operating System)**: The complete software system that includes the kernel, user interfaces, utilities, and applications to provide a user-friendly environment.

#### 39. What is difference between process and thread?
- **Process**: An independent execution unit with its own memory space, program counter, and resources.
- **Thread**: A smaller execution unit within a process, sharing the process's memory and resources but having its own program counter and stack.

- **Text Section**: Contains the executable code.
- **Data Section**: Contains global and static variables.
- **Heap**: Dynamically allocated memory during process runtime.
- **Stack**: Contains function call information, local variables, and control flow data.
- **PCB (Process Control Block)**: Contains process-related information, including process state, program counter, CPU registers, memory management information, and scheduling information.

#### 41. What is a deadlock in OS? What are the necessary conditions for a deadlock?
A deadlock is a situation where a set of processes is unable to proceed because each process is waiting for a resource held by another process. The necessary conditions for a deadlock are:
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can hold a resource at a time.
- **Hold and Wait**: A process holding a resource can request additional resources.
- **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process.
- **Circular Wait**: A circular chain of processes exists, where each process holds a resource needed by the next process in the chain.

#### 42. What do you mean by Belady’s Anomaly?
Belady's Anomaly refers to the counterintuitive situation in some page replacement algorithms (like FIFO) where increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults. This goes against the expectation that more frames should reduce page faults.

#### 43. What is spooling in OS?
Spooling (Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line) is a process where data is temporarily held in a buffer (e.g., on disk) before being sent to a peripheral device, such as a printer. It allows the CPU to perform other tasks while the peripheral device processes the data at its own pace.

### React.js Questions from Park Plus Project

1. **Explain the concept of state and props in React.js. How do they differ?**
   - **Answer:** State in React.js refers to the internal data storage of a component that can change over time, typically initialized and managed within the component itself. Props (short for properties) are read-only data passed into a component from its parent component. Props are immutable and help components communicate by passing data from one component to another.

2. **What are controlled components in React.js? How are they different from uncontrolled components?**
   - **Answer:** Controlled components are React components whose form elements (like input, textarea, select) are fully controlled by React state. This means React handles the value of the input elements and updates it based on state changes. In contrast, uncontrolled components rely on the DOM to maintain and update form data. Controlled components offer more control and enable easier synchronization between the UI state and React state.

3. **How does React Router work? Explain its role in single-page applications (SPAs).**
   - **Answer:** React Router is a library that enables navigation and routing in a React application. It uses declarative routing to map specific URLs to React components, allowing SPAs to navigate without reloading the entire page. React Router manages the application's history and provides components like `<Route>`, `<Link>`, and `<Switch>` to define navigation paths, create navigation links, and switch between different components based on the URL.

4. **What are React hooks? How do they differ from class components and why are they useful?**
   - **Answer:** React hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state and perform side effects previously only available in class components. Hooks like `useState` enable state management, `useEffect` handles side effects, and `useContext` accesses context in functional components. Hooks simplify component logic, promote code reuse, and improve readability compared to class components, which use lifecycle methods and maintain state differently.

5. **Discuss the importance of key concepts like virtual DOM and reconciliation in React.js. How do they contribute to React's performance?**
   - **Answer:** Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM maintained by React. When state or props change, React compares the virtual DOM with the previous state of the virtual DOM (reconciliation) to identify the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM. This approach optimizes performance by reducing DOM manipulations and improving rendering speed, making React applications more efficient and responsive.

Preparing answers to these questions will help you demonstrate your understanding of both the machine learning aspects of malware detection and the frontend development aspects using React.js in the Park Plus project.

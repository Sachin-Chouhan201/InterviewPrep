### React.js Questions from Park Plus Project

1. **Explain the concept of state and props in React.js. How do they differ?**
   - **Answer:** State in React.js refers to the internal data storage of a component that can change over time, typically initialized and managed within the component itself. Props (short for properties) are read-only data passed into a component from its parent component. Props are immutable and help components communicate by passing data from one component to another.

2. **What are controlled components in React.js? How are they different from uncontrolled components?**
   - **Answer:** Controlled components are React components whose form elements (like input, textarea, select) are fully controlled by React state. This means React handles the value of the input elements and updates it based on state changes. In contrast, uncontrolled components rely on the DOM to maintain and update form data. Controlled components offer more control and enable easier synchronization between the UI state and React state.

3. **How does React Router work? Explain its role in single-page applications (SPAs).**
   - **Answer:** React Router is a library that enables navigation and routing in a React application. It uses declarative routing to map specific URLs to React components, allowing SPAs to navigate without reloading the entire page. React Router manages the application's history and provides components like `<Route>`, `<Link>`, and `<Switch>` to define navigation paths, create navigation links, and switch between different components based on the URL.

4. **What are React hooks? How do they differ from class components and why are they useful?**
   - **Answer:** React hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state and perform side effects previously only available in class components. Hooks like `useState` enable state management, `useEffect` handles side effects, and `useContext` accesses context in functional components. Hooks simplify component logic, promote code reuse, and improve readability compared to class components, which use lifecycle methods and maintain state differently.

5. **Discuss the importance of key concepts like virtual DOM and reconciliation in React.js. How do they contribute to React's performance?**
   - **Answer:** Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM maintained by React. When state or props change, React compares the virtual DOM with the previous state of the virtual DOM (reconciliation) to identify the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM. This approach optimizes performance by reducing DOM manipulations and improving rendering speed, making React applications more efficient and responsive.

Preparing answers to these questions will help you demonstrate your understanding of both the machine learning aspects of malware detection and the frontend development aspects using React.js in the Park Plus project.

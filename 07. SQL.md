### Basic SQL Interview Questions

#### 1. What is SQL and its significance in database management?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to query, insert, update, and delete data. SQL is significant in database management because it provides a consistent and efficient way to interact with the database, ensuring data integrity and efficient data handling.

#### 2. Explain the difference between SQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.
- **SQL**: The language used for querying and managing relational databases.
- **MySQL**: An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL.
- **SQL Server**: A relational database management system developed by Microsoft that also uses SQL.

#### 3. What are the different types of SQL commands?
SQL commands are classified into:
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: GRANT, REVOKE.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT.

#### 4. What is a database schema?
A database schema defines the structure of the database, including tables, views, indexes, relationships, and other elements. It is a blueprint that outlines how data is organized and how relationships between data are managed.

#### 5. Explain the difference between a primary key and a foreign key.
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot be NULL.
- **Foreign Key**: A field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It creates a relationship between the two tables.

#### 6. What is a NULL value in SQL?
A NULL value represents missing or unknown data in a column. It is different from zero or an empty string and means that no value has been assigned to that field.

#### 7. What are the various data types supported in SQL?
Common data types in SQL include:
- **Numeric**: INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL.
- **Character**: CHAR, VARCHAR.
- **Date and Time**: DATE, TIME, DATETIME.
- **Binary**: BLOB.
- **Boolean**: BOOLEAN (some databases support this).

#### 8. Explain the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR data types.
- **CHAR**: Fixed-length character data type. It pads extra spaces to fill the specified length.
- **VARCHAR**: Variable-length character data type. It stores only the actual number of characters, plus one byte for the length.

#### 9. What is a constraint in SQL? Provide examples of different types of constraints.
A constraint is a rule enforced on data columns in a table to ensure data integrity. Examples include:
- **Primary Key**: Ensures unique identification of each row.
- **Foreign Key**: Maintains referential integrity between tables.
- **Unique**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
- **Not Null**: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
- **Check**: Ensures all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
- **Default**: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.

#### 10. How do you comment in SQL?
- **Single-line comment**: `-- This is a single-line comment`
- **Multi-line comment**: `/* This is a multi-line comment */`

### Intermediate SQL Interview Questions

#### 11. What is a SQL query?
A SQL query is a statement used to perform a specific task, such as retrieving data from a database, updating records, or deleting data. For example: `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';`

#### 12. Explain the difference between DDL, DML, and DCL commands in SQL.
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Defines and modifies database structures. Commands include CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Manipulates data within existing structures. Commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Controls access to the data. Commands include GRANT, REVOKE.

#### 13. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses in SQL?
- **WHERE**: Filters rows before grouping them. Used with SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statements.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;
  ```
- **HAVING**: Filters groups after the aggregation is performed. Used with GROUP BY clause.
  ```sql
  SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
  ```

#### 14. Explain the concept of JOIN in SQL with examples.
JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column:
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records with matching values in both tables.
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.department
  FROM employees
  INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
  ```
- **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.department
  FROM employees
  LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
  ```
- **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left table. If no match, NULLs are returned.
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.department
  FROM employees
  RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
  ```
- **FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)**: Returns records when there is a match in one of the tables. If no match, NULLs are returned.
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.department
  FROM employees
  FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
  ```

#### 15. What is a subquery in SQL?
A subquery is a query nested within another SQL query. It can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements to provide results to the main query.
Example:
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE department = 'Sales');
```

#### 16. How do you perform sorting in SQL?
Sorting is performed using the `ORDER BY` clause. You can sort results in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.
Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY name ASC;
```

#### 17. What is a stored procedure? How do you create and execute a stored procedure in SQL?
A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be saved and reused. It can accept parameters and perform complex operations.
- **Create**:
  ```sql
  CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeCount
  AS
  BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
  END;
  ```
- **Execute**:
  ```sql
  EXEC GetEmployeeCount;
  ```

#### 18. Explain the concept of transaction management in SQL.
Transaction management ensures that a series of SQL operations are executed as a single unit, maintaining data integrity. It uses commands like:
- **BEGIN TRANSACTION**: Starts a transaction.
- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made during the transaction.
- **ROLLBACK**: Reverts changes made during the transaction if an error occurs.
Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO accounts (account_number, balance) VALUES (12345, 1000);
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_number = 12345;
COMMIT;
```

#### 19. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQL?
- **UNION**: Combines results of two or more SELECT statements and removes duplicates.
- **UNION ALL**: Combines results of two or more SELECT statements and includes duplicates.
Example:
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales'
UNION
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Marketing';
```

#### 20. How do you handle duplicate records in a SQL query?
To handle duplicates, you can use the `DISTINCT` keyword to select only unique records.
Example:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM employees;
```

### Advanced SQL Interview Questions

#### 21. Explain the concept of indexing in SQL. How does indexing improve query performance?
Indexing is a way to optimize database performance by creating a data structure (index) that improves the speed of data retrieval operations. Indexes allow the database to find data quickly without scanning the entire table.
Example:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees(name);
```

#### 22. What are the different types of indexes in SQL?
- **Clustered Index**: Determines the physical order of data in a table. Only one per table.
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Does not alter the physical order of data. Multiple non-clustered indexes per table.

#### 23. What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes?
- **Clustered Index**: Sorts and stores the data rows of the table or view in order based on the index key. One per table.
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Contains a separate structure from the data rows. Pointers to the data rows are sorted based on the index key. Multiple per table.

#### 24. Explain the concept of normalization and denormalization in SQL.
- **Normalization**: Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables.
- **Denormalization**: Process ofcombining tables to reduce the number of joins and improve query performance. Denormalization can involve adding redundant data to tables to simplify queries.

#### 25. What are SQL injection attacks, and how can they be prevented?
SQL injection is a type of cyberattack where malicious SQL code is inserted into input fields to manipulate databases. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or data loss. Prevention methods include:
- Using parameterized queries or prepared statements.
- Validating and sanitizing input data.
- Implementing proper authentication and access controls.

#### 26. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands in SQL?
- **DELETE**: Removes rows from a table based on a condition. It generates an entry in the transaction log for each deleted row.
- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows from a table. It is faster than DELETE because it does not generate individual transaction log entries.

#### 27. Explain the concept of triggers in SQL. When and why do we use triggers?
Triggers are special stored procedures that automatically execute in response to events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table. Triggers are used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, and automate tasks.

#### 28. What is the difference between an inner join and an outer join in SQL?
- **Inner Join**: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined.
- **Outer Join**: Returns all rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table. There are three types of outer joins: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.

#### 29. Explain the concept of recursive queries in SQL. Provide an example.
Recursive queries are SQL queries that reference a table multiple times in the FROM clause. They are used to perform hierarchical or tree-structured queries.
Example:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
  SELECT id, name, manager_id
  FROM employees
  WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id
  FROM employees e
  JOIN cte ON e.manager_id = cte.id
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

#### 30. How do you handle NULL values in SQL?
You can handle NULL values in SQL using functions like COALESCE or IS NULL.
- **COALESCE**: Returns the first non-NULL value in a list of expressions.
  ```sql
  SELECT COALESCE(column_name, 'N/A') FROM table_name;
  ```
- **IS NULL**: Checks if a value is NULL.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
  ```

### Additional Topics Possibly Asked in TCS Prime Interview:

#### Advanced SQL Concepts:

#### 31. Discuss the benefits of using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL queries.
CTEs provide better readability, modularization, and recursion support in SQL queries. They can simplify complex queries and improve query performance.

#### 32. Explain the concept of window functions in SQL. Provide examples of window functions.
Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. Examples include ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and LEAD().
Example:
```sql
SELECT name, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```

#### 33. What are the different types of SQL constraints, and how do you enforce them?
SQL constraints include NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, and DEFAULT. They are enforced using the ALTER TABLE or CREATE TABLE statements.

#### 34. Explain the concept of data integrity in SQL. How do you ensure data integrity in a database?
Data integrity ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data stored in a database. It is maintained through constraints, referential integrity, and transaction management.

#### 35. Discuss the differences between SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL in terms of features and capabilities.
SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL are all popular relational database management systems (RDBMS) with different features, licensing models, and performance characteristics. Comparing them involves examining factors such as scalability, availability, security, and cost.

### Performance Optimization and Query Tuning:

#### 36. What are some common techniques for optimizing SQL query performance?
Common techniques include indexing, optimizing database schema, using efficient SQL queries, minimizing network traffic, and caching query results.

#### 37. Explain the importance of execution plans in SQL query optimization.
Execution plans provide insights into how a database engine executes a query. Analyzing execution plans helps identify inefficiencies, such as full table scans or missing indexes, and optimize queries accordingly.

#### 38. What is the purpose of database normalization, and how does it impact query performance?
Database normalization organizes data to minimize redundancy and dependency. While it improves data integrity, normalization can lead to performance overhead due to increased join operations. Denormalization is often used to improve query performance.

#### 39. Discuss the role of indexes in improving SQL query performance.
Indexes improve query performance by providing fast access to data. They reduce the number of rows that need to be scanned during query execution, resulting in faster data retrieval.

#### 40. How do you identify and troubleshoot performance bottlenecks in SQL queries?
Performance bottlenecks can be identified using tools like database profilers, execution plans, and monitoring tools. Troubleshooting involves analyzing query execution times, resource utilization, and database configuration settings to pinpoint bottlenecks and optimize queries.

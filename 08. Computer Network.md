### Intermediate Interview Questions:

#### 12. Describe the OSI Reference Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. This model aids in understanding and designing a network architecture that is robust, interoperable, and scalable.

#### 13. Define the 7 different layers of the OSI Reference Model

2. **Data Link Layer**: Responsible for node-to-node data transfer, error detection, and correction. It includes MAC and LLC sub-layers.
3. **Network Layer**: Manages device addressing, tracks the location of devices on the network, and determines the best way to move data.
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures complete data transfer with error recovery and flow control (e.g., TCP, UDP).
5. **Session Layer**: Manages and controls the connections between computers. Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates data between the application layer and the network format, encrypts and compresses data.

### Advanced Interview Questions:

#### 21. What is the TCP protocol?
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite that provides reliable, ordered, and

 error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts communicating over an IP network. It is connection-oriented and ensures data integrity.

#### 22. What is the UDP protocol?
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite used for low-latency and loss-tolerating connections. It is connectionless and does not guarantee reliable communication, making it faster and more efficient for certain applications like streaming and gaming.

#### 23. Compare between TCP and UDP
- **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented, ensures data integrity, used for applications where data accuracy is critical (e.g., web browsing, email).

- **MAC Address**: Hardware address, unique to each network interface card, used for local network communication.
- **IP Address**: Logical address, can change, used for identifying devices across different networks and for routing data.

#### 30. What is a subnet?
A subnet (subnetwork) is a logical subdivision of an IP network. It divides a large network into smaller, more manageable segments, improving network performance and security. Subnets are identified by a subnet mask.

#### 31. Compare the hub vs switch
- **Hub**: A basic networking device that broadcasts incoming data packets to all ports regardless of the destination. It operates at the physical layer.
- **Switch**: A more advanced device that routes data packets only to the specific device intended as the recipient. It operates at the data link layer and can support more efficient and secure communication.

### Additional Networking Interview Questions:

#### 36. Explain the concept of subnetting and supernetting.
- **Subnetting**: Dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks to improve performance and security.
- **Supernetting**: Combining multiple smaller networks into a larger address block to simplify routing and reduce the size of routing tables.

#### 37. What is the purpose of a subnet mask?
A subnet mask is used to divide an IP address into a network and host portion, defining the range of IP addresses within a subnet. It helps in identifying the network to which an IP address belongs.

- **Static NAT**: One-to-one mapping between private and public IP addresses.
- **Dynamic NAT**: Maps private IP addresses to a pool of public IP addresses.
- **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: Many-to-one mapping, using different ports to distinguish between connections.

#### 40. Explain the concept of VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network).
A VLAN is a logical grouping of devices within a network, segmented by the switch to create separate broadcast domains. It improves network efficiency and security by isolating traffic and limiting broadcast domains.

#### 41. Describe the difference between half-duplex and full-duplex communication.
- **Half-Duplex**: Communication where data transmission can occur in both directions, but not simultaneously (e.g., walkie-talkie).
- **Full-Duplex**: Communication where data transmission can occur in both directions simultaneously (e.g., telephone).

#### 42. What is a MAC address table, and how does it function in a network switch?
A MAC address table is a database used by network switches to map MAC addresses to switch ports. It enables the switch to forward data packets to the correct destination port based on the MAC address.

#### 43. Explain the purpose and operation of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).
ARP translates IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network. When a device wants to communicate with another device, it uses ARP to find the MAC address associated with the destination IP address.

#### 44. Describe the concept of CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation.
CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing that replaces the traditional class-based IP addressing. CIDR notation includes the IP address followed by a slash and the subnet mask length (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

#### 45. What is a broadcast storm, and how can it be prevented?
A broadcast storm occurs when there are too many broadcast packets on the network, overwhelming the network and causing congestion. It can be prevented by:
- **Limiting the size of broadcast domains** using VLANs.
- **Implementing Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** to prevent loops.
- **Using broadcast suppression** features on network devices.

#### 46. Explain the difference between a router and a switch.

- **Switch**: Connects devices within the same network, using MAC addresses to forward data frames to the correct destination.

#### 47. What is a proxy server, and how does it work?
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and the internet. It forwards client requests to the server and returns the server's response to the client. It can enhance security, control access, and cache content for faster retrieval.

#### 48. Describe the role of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) in network configuration.
DHCP automates the assignment of IP addresses and other network configuration parameters (e.g., subnet mask, gateway) to devices on a network. This simplifies network management and ensures that devices have unique IP addresses.

#### 49. Explain the concept of Quality of Service (QoS) in networking.
QoS refers to the set of techniques used to manage network traffic, ensuring the performance of critical applications by prioritizing certain types of data (e.g., voice, video) and controlling the allocation of bandwidth.

#### 50. What is a DNS cache poisoning attack, and how can it be mitigated?
A DNS cache poisoning attack involves injecting false DNS entries into the cache of a DNS resolver, redirecting users to malicious websites. It can be mitigated by:
- **Using DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)** to authenticate DNS responses.

MAC filtering restricts network access based on the MAC addresses of devices. Only devices with approved MAC addresses can connect to the network. It enhances security by limiting which devices can access the wireless network.

#### 53. What is the purpose of a default gateway in networking?
A default gateway is a router that connects a local network to external networks, usually the internet. It serves as the access point or IP address through which a device sends data to another network or the internet.

#### 54. Describe the function of a network firewall and its types.
A network firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Types include:
- **Packet-Filtering Firewall**: Inspects packets and allows or denies them based on the source and destination addresses, ports, or protocols.
- **Stateful Inspection Firewall**: Monitors the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of traffic.
- **Proxy Firewall**: Acts as an intermediary for requests between clients and servers, inspecting the entire packet content.
- **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**: Combines traditional firewall capabilities with additional features like intrusion prevention and application awareness.

#### 55. Explain the concept of port forwarding and its use in networking.
Port forwarding redirects communication requests from one address and port number to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a router. It allows external devices to access services on a private network, such as hosting a web server.
